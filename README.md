This website template was made by the Memory Lab Network and is available for use by any organization that wishes to run a Memory Lab.

The Memory Lab Network is a project at DC Public Library (DCPL) funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) through a National Leadership Grant to build Memory Lab digital preservation programs in public libraries across the U.S. based on the DCPL Memory Lab model. Through an application process, public libraries were identified as the Memory Lab Network project partners. All Memory Lab Network partners receive training, mentoring and financial support to create digitization stations and curricula to build public knowledge and skills around the complex and paralyzing problems of personal digital archiving through their own Memory Lab programs.

DC Public Library’s Memory Lab was established in 2015 by a year-long National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR), resulting in a “do-it-yourself” program consisting of three key components: A digitization lab with equipment for digitizing video and audio and scanning photographs, documents, and slides in a public computing space; digital preservation class curricula and training for the public; and a website with equipment and workflow instructions and resources for long-term storage and preservation of analog and digital archival materials. The NDSR project final report and the original project proposal are both available online. The residency was funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services and administered by the Library of Congress.

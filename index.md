### The Memory Lab
#### *What is it?*
A physical space that provides equipment for transferring your home movies, photographs, and slides to digital files. It's a do-it-yourself (DIY)  model, meaning we provide step-by-step instructions, but you control the process from start to finish. 

It's an [online resource](https://libguides.dclibrary.org/memorylab/resources). Learn how to take care of your physical and digital possessions and get resources to help you in your personal archiving projects from the DC Public Library. 

It's a series of classes and programs related to personal archiving. Check out the Library's [online calendar](https://www.dclibrary.org/calendar) for upcoming events near you!

#### *Why should I use it?*

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. 

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).


#### *How do I use it?*

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/memorylabnetwork/website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
